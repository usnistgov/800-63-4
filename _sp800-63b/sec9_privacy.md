# Privacy Considerations {#sec9}

*These privacy considerations supplement the guidance in Sec. 4. This section is informative.*

## Privacy Risk Assessment

[Sections 4.1.5](sec4_aal.md#aal1records), [4.2.5](sec4_aal.md#aal2records), and [4.3.5](sec4_aal.md#aal3records) require the CSP to conduct a privacy risk assessment for records retention. Such a privacy risk assessment would include:

1. The likelihood that the records retention could create a problem for the subscriber, such as invasiveness or unauthorized access to the information.
2. The impact if such a problem did occur.

CSPs should be able to reasonably justify any response they take to identified privacy risks, including accepting the risk, mitigating the risk, and sharing the risk. The use of subscriber consent is a form of sharing the risk, and therefore appropriate for use only when a subscriber could reasonably be expected to have the capacity to assess and accept the shared risk.

## Privacy Controls

[Section 4.4](sec4_aal.md#aal_privacy) requires CSPs to employ appropriately tailored privacy controls. [[SP800-53]](references.md#ref-SP800-53) provides a set of privacy controls for CSPs to consider when deploying authentication mechanisms. These controls cover notices, redress, and other important considerations for successful and trustworthy deployments.

## Use Limitation

[Section 4.4](sec4_aal.md#aal_privacy) requires CSPs to use measures to maintain the objectives of predictability (enabling reliable assumptions by individuals, owners, and operators about PII and its processing by an information system) and manageability (providing the capability for granular administration of PII, including alteration, deletion, and selective disclosure) commensurate with privacy risks that can arise from the processing of attributes for purposes other than identity proofing, authentication, authorization, or attribute assertion, related fraud mitigation, or to comply with law or legal process [[NISTIR8062]](references.md#ref-NISTIR8062).

CSPs may have various business purposes for processing attributes, including providing non-identity services to subscribers. However, processing attributes for other purposes than those specified at collection can create privacy risks when individuals are not expecting or comfortable with the additional processing. CSPs can determine appropriate measures commensurate with the privacy risk arising from the additional processing. For example, absent applicable law, regulation or policy, it may not be necessary to get consent when processing attributes to provide non-identity services requested by subscribers, although notices may help subscribers maintain reliable assumptions about the processing (predictability). Other processing of attributes may carry different privacy risks that call for obtaining consent or allowing subscribers more control over the use or disclosure of specific attributes (manageability). Subscriber consent needs to be meaningful; therefore, as stated in [Sec. 4.4](sec4_aal.md#aal_privacy), when CSPs use consent measures, acceptance by the subscriber of additional uses shall not be a condition of providing authentication services.

Consult the agency SAOP if there are questions about whether the proposed processing falls outside the scope of the permitted processing or the appropriate privacy risk mitigation measures.

## Agency-Specific Privacy Compliance {#agency-privacy}

[Section 4.4](sec4_aal.md#aal_privacy) covers specific compliance obligations for federal CSPs. It is critical to involve the agency SAOP in the earliest stages of digital authentication system development in order to assess and mitigate privacy risks and advise the agency on compliance requirements, such as whether or not the collection of PII to issue or maintain authenticators triggers the *Privacy Act of 1974* [[PrivacyAct]](references.md#ref-PrivacyAct) or the *E-Government Act of 2002* [[E-Gov]](references.md#ref-E-Gov) requirement to conduct a PIA. For example, with respect to centralized maintenance of biometrics, it is likely that the Privacy Act requirements will be triggered and require coverage by either a new or existing Privacy Act system of records due to the collection and maintenance of PII and any other attributes necessary for authentication. The SAOP can similarly assist the agency in determining whether a PIA is required.

These considerations should not be read as a requirement to develop a Privacy Act SORN or PIA for authentication alone. In many cases it will make the most sense to draft a PIA and SORN that encompasses the entire digital identity process or include the digital authentication process as part of a larger programmatic PIA that discusses the online service or benefit that the agency is establishing.

Due to the many components of digital authentication, it is important for the SAOP to have an awareness and understanding of each individual component. For example, other privacy artifacts may be applicable to an agency offering or using federated CSP or RP services (e.g., Data Use Agreements, Computer Matching Agreements). The SAOP can assist the agency in determining what additional requirements apply. Moreover, a thorough understanding of the individual components of digital authentication will enable the SAOP to thoroughly assess and mitigate privacy risks either through compliance processes or by other means.
