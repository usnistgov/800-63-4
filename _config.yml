abstract:
  sp800-63:
    subject: "These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. The guidelines cover identity proofing and authentication of users (such as employees, contractors, or private individuals) interacting with government information systems over networks. They define technical requirements in each of the areas of identity proofing, registration, authenticators, management processes, authentication protocols, federation, and related assertions. This publication will supersede NIST Special Publication 800-63-3."
    keywords: 'authentication; authentication assurance; authenticator; assertions; credential service provider; digital authentication; digital credentials; identity proofing; federation; passwords; PKI.'
  sp800-63a:
    subject: "These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. This guideline focuses on the enrollment and verification of an identity for use in digital authentication. Central to this is a process known as identity proofing in which an applicant provides evidence to a credential service provider (CSP) reliably identifying themselves, thereby allowing the CSP to assert that identification at a useful identity assurance level. This document defines technical requirements for each of three identity assurance levels. This publication will supersede NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63A."
    keywords: 'authentication; credential service provider; electronic authentication; digital authentication; electronic credentials; digital credentials; identity proofing; federation.'
  sp800-63b:
    subject: "These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. These guidelines focus on the authentication of subjects interacting with government information systems over networks, establishing that a given claimant is a subscriber who has been previously authenticated. The result of the authentication process may be used locally by the system performing the authentication or may be asserted elsewhere in a federated identity system. This document defines technical requirements for each of the three authenticator assurance levels. This publication will supersede NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63B."
    keywords: 'authentication; authentication assurance; credential service provider; digital authentication; digital credentials; electronic authentication; electronic credentials; passwords.'
  sp800-63c:
    subject: "These guidelines provide technical requirements for federal agencies implementing digital identity services and are not intended to constrain the development or use of standards outside of this purpose. This guideline focuses on the use of federated identity and the use of assertions to implement identity federations. Federation allows a given credential service provider to provide authentication attributes and (optionally) subscriber attributes to a number of separately-administered relying parties. Similarly, relying parties may use more than one credential service provider. This publication will supersede NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-63C."
    keywords: 'assertions; authentication; credential service provider; digital authentication; electronic authentication; electronic credentials; federations.'
