# Federation Assurance Level (FAL) {#fal}

*This section is normative.*

This section defines allowable *federation assurance levels* (FALs). The FAL describes requirements for securing federation transactions, including requirements on how relationships between IdPs and RPs are established and how assertions are presented and protected. These levels can be requested by an RP at runtime or required by the configuration of both the RP and the IdP for a given transaction. The FAL provides assurances for the RP receiving the assertion as well as assurances for the IdP creating the assertion to be used by an RP.

While many different federation implementation options are possible, the FAL is intended to provide clear guidance representing increasingly secure deployment options. See [[SP800-63]](../_sp800-63/sec1_purpose.md#purpose){:latex-href="#ref-SP800-63"} for details on how to choose the most appropriate FAL.

Each FAL is characterized by a set of requirements that increase the security and complexity as the FAL increases. These requirements are listed here and expanded in other sections of this document:

Cryptographic Verifiability
: The assertion presented in the federation protocol is traceable back to a specific IdP that issued it, and that connection can be verified with a cryptographic mechanism such as a digital signature or MAC. This also allows the RP to verify that the assertion was not modified or forged. This is required at all FALs.

Audience Restriction
: The assertion presented in the federation protocol is targeted to a specific RP and the RP can verify that it is the intended audience of the assertion. This is required at all FALs.

Injection Protection
: The RP is strongly protected from an attacker presenting an assertion in circumstances outside a current federation transaction request.

Trust Agreement
: The IdP and RP have agreed to participate in a federation transaction with each other for the purposes of logging in the subscriber to the RP. This can be traced back to a static agreement between the parties or occur implicitly from the connection itself.

Registration
: The IdP and RP have exchanged identifiers and key material to allow for the verification of assertions and other artifacts during future federation transactions.

Presentation
: The assertion can be presented to the RP either on its own (as a bearer assertion) or in concert with a bound authenticator presented by the subscriber.

[Table 1](sec4_fal.md#table-1) provides a non-normative summary of aspects for each FAL. Each successive level subsumes and fulfills all requirements of lower levels (e.g., a federation process at FAL3 can be accepted at FAL2 or FAL1 since FAL3 satisfies all the requirements of these lower levels). Combinations not found in the [Table 1](sec4_fal.md#table-1) are possible but outside the scope of this volume.

At all FALs, all assertions **SHALL** be used with a federation protocol as described in [Sec. 5](sec5_federation.md#federation). All assertions **SHALL** comply with the detailed requirements in [Sec. 6](sec6_assertions.md#assertions). All assertions **SHALL** be presented using one of the methods described in [Sec. 7](sec7_presentation.md#presentation). Examples of assertions used in federated protocols include the ID Token in OpenID Connect [[OIDC]](references.md#ref-OIDC) and assertions written in the Security Assertion Markup Language [[SAML]](references.md#ref-SAML).

At all FALs, the IdP **SHALL** employ appropriately tailored security controls (to include control enhancements) from the moderate or high baseline of security controls defined in [[SP800-53]](references.md#ref-SP800-53) or equivalent federal (e.g., [[FEDRAMP]](references.md#ref-FEDRAMP)) or industry standard.

## Federation Assurance Level 1 (FAL1) {#fal1}

At FAL1, the assertion being generated by the IdP **SHALL** meet a core set of requirements defined in [Sec. 6](sec6_assertions.md#assertions), including protection against modification or construction by an attacker by having the assertion contents signed by the IdP using approved cryptography. An RP **SHALL** verify the origin and integrity of the assertion upon receipt, as discussed in [Sec. 6](sec6_assertions.md#assertions), ensuring that the assertion has originated from the expected source.

All assertions at FAL1 **SHALL** be audience-restricted to a specific RP or set of RPs, and the RP **SHALL** validate that it is one of the targeted RPs for the given assertion. The IdP **SHALL** ensure that any party holding the assertion, including the RP, is unable to impersonate the IdP at a non-targeted RP by protecting the assertion with a signature and key using approved cryptography. If the assertion is protected by a digital signature using an asymmetric key, the IdP **MAY** use the same public and private key pair to sign assertions to multiple RPs. The IdP **MAY** publish its public key in a verifiable fashion, such as at an HTTPS-protected URL at a well-known location. If the assertion is protected by a keyed message authentication code (MAC) using a shared key, the IdP **SHALL** use a different shared key for each RP.

At FAL1, the trust agreement between the IdP and RP **MAY** be established entirely dynamically. For instance, the subscriber can identify their chosen IdP to the RP at runtime, allowing the RP to discover the IdP's parameters and register itself for use by the subscriber. The subscriber is prompted by the IdP to determine which attributes are released to the RP, and for what purposes. In this example, the trust between the IdP and RP is driven entirely by the desires and actions of the subscriber. Note that at FAL1, it is still possible for the trust agreement and registration to happen statically.

In existing federation protocols, FAL1 can be implemented with the OpenID Connect Implicit Client profile [[OIDC-Implicit]](references.md#ref-OIDC-implicit), the OpenID Connect Hybrid Client profile in [[OIDC]](references.md#ref-OIDC), or the SAML Web SSO [[SAML-WebSSO]](references.md#ref-SAML-websso) profile with no additional features. In each of these profiles, the assertion is signed by the IdP and the RP is identified in a portion of the assertion covered by the signature.

## Federation Assurance Level 2 (FAL2) {#fal2}

All the requirements for FAL1 apply at FAL2 except where overridden by more specific or stringent requirements here.

At FAL2, the assertion **SHALL** also be strongly protected from being injected by an attacker. To accomplish this, the assertion **SHOULD** be presented using back channel presentation as discussed in [Sec. 7.1](sec7_presentation.md#back-channel), as in the OpenID Connect Basic Client profile [[OIDC-Basic]](references.md#ref-OIDC-basic). In this presentation method, the RP fetches the assertion directly from the IdP by using a single-use assertion reference, thereby preventing an attacker from injecting the assertions through an external access point. If front channel presentation is used as discussed in [Sec. 7.2](sec7_presentation.md#front-channel), additional injection protections **SHALL** be implemented by the RP.

Regardless of the presentation method used, injection attacks can be further mitigated by always requiring that the federation transaction start at the RP instead of being initiated by the IdP, thereby allowing the RP to associate an incoming assertion with a specific request that the subscriber initiated within a continuous session.

At FAL2, the trust agreement between the IdP and RP **SHALL** be established statically, including establishing limits of which attributes are made available to the RP and for what purpose. This trust agreement **MAY** be bilateral between the IdP and RP or **MAY** be managed through the use of a multilateral federation partnership. The registration **MAY** be dynamic, provided that the RP and IdP can prove their connection at runtime to the established trust agreement between them. Such methods for this proof vary by federation protocol, but can include presentation of software attestations and proof of control over URLs at trusted domains.

Government-operated IdPs asserting authentication at FAL2 **SHALL** protect keys used for signing or encrypting those assertions with mechanisms validated at [[FIPS140]](references.md#ref-FIPS140) Level 1 or higher.

## Federation Assurance Level 3 (FAL3) {#fal3}

All the requirements at FAL1 and FAL2 apply at FAL3 except where overridden by more specific or stringent requirements here.

At FAL3, the subscriber **SHALL** authenticate to the RP by presenting an authenticator directly to the RP in addition to presenting an assertion. The authenticator presented is known as a _bound authenticator_, described in [Sec. 6.1.2](sec6_assertions.md#boundauth). For example, the subscriber goes through a federated login process at the IdP and RP, and the RP then prompts the subscriber for a bound authenticator that is associated with that RP subscriber account. The bound authenticator presented at FAL3 need not be the same authenticator used by the subscriber to authenticate to the IdP. The assertion is used to identify the subscriber to the RP while the bound authenticator gives very high assurance that the party attempting to log in is the subscriber identified in the assertion. FAL3 is not reached at the RP until the subscriber authenticates with the bound authenticator and the RP verifies that the authenticator presented is correctly bound to the RP subscriber account identified by the assertion.

At FAL3, the trust agreement and registration between the IdP and RP **SHALL** be established statically. All identifying key material and federation parameters for all parties  (including the list of attributes sent to the RP) **SHALL** be fixed ahead of time, before the federated authentication process can take place. Runtime decisions **MAY** be used to further limit what is sent between parties in the federated authentication process (e.g., a runtime decision could opt to not disclose an email address even though this attribute was included in the parameters of the trust agreement).

IdPs asserting authentication at FAL3 **SHALL** protect keys used for signing or encrypting those assertions with mechanisms validated at [[FIPS140]](references.md#ref-FIPS140) Level 1 or higher.

## Requesting and Processing xALs {#request-xals}

Since an IdP is capable of asserting the identities of many different subscribers with a variety of authenticators using a variety of federation parameters, the IAL, AAL, and FAL could vary across different federated logins, even to the same RP.

The RP **SHALL** be informed of the following information for each federated transaction:

- The IAL of the subscriber account being presented to the RP, or an indication that no IAL claim is being made
- The AAL of the currently active session of the subscriber at the IdP, or an indication that no AAL claim is being made
- The FAL of the federated transaction

The RP gets this xAL information from a combination of parameters in the trust agreement as described in [Sec. 5.1](sec5_federation.md#trust-agreement#trust-agreement) and information included in the assertion as described in [Sec. 6](sec6_assertions.md#assertions). If the xAL is unchanging for all messages between the IdP and RP, the xAL information **SHALL** be included in the parameters of the trust agreement between the IdP and RP. If the xAL varies, the information **SHALL** be included as part of the assertion as discussed in [Sec. 6](sec6_assertions.md#assertions).

The IdP **MAY** indicate that no claim is made to the IAL or AAL for a given federation transaction. In such cases, no default value is assigned to the resulting xAL. That is to say, a federation transaction without an IAL declaration in either the trust agreement or the assertion is functionally considered to have "no IAL" and the RP cannot assume the account meets "IAL1", the lowest numbered IAL described in this suite.

The RP **SHALL** determine the minimum IAL, AAL, and FAL it is willing to accept for access to any offered functionality. An RP **MAY** vary its functionality based on the IAL, AAL, and FAL of a specific federated authentication. For example, an RP can allow login at AAL2 for common functionality (e.g., viewing the status of a dam system) but require AAL3 be used for higher risk functionality (e.g., changing the flow rates of a dam system). Similarly, an RP could restrict management functionality to only certain subscriber accounts which have been identity proofed at IAL2, while allowing logins from all subscriber accounts regardless of IAL.

In a federation process, only the IdP has direct access to the details of the subscriber account, which determines the applicable IAL, and the authentication event at the IdP, which determines the applicable AAL. Consequently, the RP **SHALL** consider the IdP's declaration of the IAL and AAL as the sole source of these levels for a given federated transaction.

The RP **SHALL** ensure that the federation transaction meets the requirements of the FAL declared in the assertion. For example, the RP needs to ensure the presentation method meets the injection protection requirements at FAL2 and above, and that the appropriate bound authenticator is presented at FAL3.

IdPs **SHALL** support a mechanism for RPs to specify a set of minimum acceptable xALs as part of the trust agreement and **SHOULD** support the RP specifying a more strict minimum set at runtime as part of the federation transaction. When an RP requests a particular xAL, the IdP **SHOULD** fulfill that request, if possible, and **SHALL** indicate the resulting xAL in the assertion. For example, if the subscriber has an active session that was authenticated at AAL1, but the RP has requested AAL2, the IdP needs to prompt the subscriber for AAL2 authentication to step up the security of the session at the IdP during the subscriber's interaction at the IdP, if possible. The IdP sends the resulting AAL as part of the returned assertion, whether it is AAL1 (the original session) or AAL2 (a stepped-up authentication).
