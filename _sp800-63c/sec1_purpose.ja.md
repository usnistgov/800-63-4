# Purpose {#purpose}

_This section is informative._

This publication and its companion volumes, [[SP800-63]](../_sp800-63/sec1_purpose.md#purpose){:latex-href="#ref-SP800-63"}, [[SP800-63A]](../_sp800-63a/sec1_purpose.md#purpose){:latex-href="#ref-SP800-63A"}, and [[SP800-63B]](../_sp800-63b/sec1_purpose.md#purpose){:latex-href="#ref-SP800-63B"}, provide technical guidelines to organizations for the implementation of digital identity services.

This document, SP 800-63C, provides requirements to identity providers (IdPs) and relying parties (RPs) of federated identity systems. Federation allows a given IdP to provide authentication attributes and (optionally) subscriber attributes to a number of separately-administered RPs through the use of federation protocols and assertions. Similarly, RPs can use more than one IdP as sources of identities.
