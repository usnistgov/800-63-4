_This section is informative._

This publication and its companion volumes, [[SP800-63]](../_sp800-63/sec1_purpose.md#purpose){:latex-href="#ref-SP800-63"}, [[SP800-63B]](../_sp800-63b/sec1_purpose.md#purpose){:latex-href="#ref-SP800-63B"}, and [[SP800-63C]](../_sp800-63c/sec1_purpose.md#purpose){:latex-href="#ref-SP800-63C"}, provide technical guidelines to organizations for the implementation of digital identity services.

This document provides requirements for the identity proofing of individuals at each Identity Assurance Level (IAL) for the purposes of enrolling them into an identity service or providing them access to online resources.  It applies to the identity proofing of individuals over a network or in person.  Verifying the identities of people calling into a customer support service or a call center is out of scope for this document.
